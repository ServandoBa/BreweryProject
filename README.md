### **Extract**
The data was retrieved from ....

### **Transform**
The transformation and cleaning process was developed in PostgreSQL. Below, you will find the script used to transform the data from the Breweries data file. This transformation was carried out to obtain support columns such as Business Type, Is Active, Zip Code, State, and City in a usable format.




### **Load**
Once the data was prepared for the presentation, it was uploaded to Tableau to create the dashboard. There are 2 views, the Executive dashboard and the Regional dashboard. Each view has a different level of detail in order to show relevant metrics measuring financial and operative performance across the multiple breweries.
